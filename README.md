 ·Number of staff in Woji branch is 6, they have more sales on Fridays, there is a significant growth in sales in Woji, and a total of 1,199 units were sold in the branch.
## Employees
·Emeka generated the highest sales revenue of $3,109. We recommend that he should be appointed the General Manager.

·In Woji branch, we recommend Tolu as the branch manager.
·In GRA branch, we recommend Chioma as brand manager.
·In Town branch, we recommend Uche as the branch manager.
·We recommend that Tonye should be fired because Tonye generated the lowest sales revenue, and Tonye is in Woji branch where we have the top 3 performing staff.
## Weekly Performance
·Overall, highest sales were generated on Monday, with a total of $3,515.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
·Branch: the business has 6 staff in Woji branch and 2 in Town branch, and the total sales Woji ($11,139), and Town ($2,487). The number of staff is one of the reasons why Town has low sales. This trend is also seen in GRA branch. I therefore recommend that more staff be sent to Town. And across all branches, the minimum number of staff should be 5.
·Number of work days: Across all branches, we discovered that the number of days affects the performance of the staff and the branch. We recommend that it be mandatory that all staff work at least 5 days a week, with possible shifts.
·Town branch: The two staff in Town branch (Uche and Tunde), should go for training with the leaders in Woji or GRA branch. Staff rotation will also help to revive the branch.
